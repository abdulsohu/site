# The Creation of This Website

> The not so many reasons I built this site.

## Some Background

During the [COVID-19 Lockdown](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=covid+19), I had to do something that would render my time productive, and preferaby, didn't require more of me than sitting at my computer and figuring out things (because I know no better). I wasn't quite sure what that something would be. In the meantime, one of my friends introduced me to [Github's Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). While that didn't mean much to me at first glance, everything suddenly clicked when I was wrapping up one of my final projects for a Python course: building a website in the [Django]() framework. In line with my instructor's expectations, the idea that making a website is _not that hard_ planted itself, and promptly so.

Surely the jump from running a website on my computer's `localhost:3000` to running one that is globally available couldn't be ~~that~~ hard. I truly wish I could say "well, it wasn't" or "well, I couldn't be more wrong about that": both these endings give you the expected conclusion every reader is always looking for. Frankly, however, at times the process was harder that I thought it could be and often, it was actually easier than I expected it to be. It was a good mix, the kind that leaves you sastisfied with the final product.

Now, I could have just used a bespoke provider along the likes of [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and satisfied my aesthetic urges with the a selection of bespoke themes that came with that serving. But in the words of my finance friend who wouldn't get why I wanted to spend so much time doing it all from scratch: "in the computer science community, you're looked down upon if you don't build your own website". Now, I'm not exactly sure how true that is, but it sounded right. Besides, it is pretty commonplace for computer scientists to maintain an online presence of sorts where they document their accomplishments and publish their technical musings. As you can see, I am no different.

## This Site

I considered using the Django framework to build this site, having had some prior exposure with it. But, since the design for my website was inspired by [Arun Kirubarajan's](https://kirubarajan.com/), and his is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (which uses React behind the scenes), who was I to deviate from the new norm. Moreover, I had just learned about static websites and really wanted this site to be one. Another motivation of why I wanted to build this site was to learn something new, so understandably, having no prior experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/), it just seemed naturally fitting that I used Gatsby.

I dipped my toes into Jekyll, Hugo and Middleman as well, for research's sake, but the resources and documentation in the GatsbyJS community were overwhelmingly impressive and no major _comparative_ red flags arose during the time I was considering all my options. In fact, there seemed to be an assortment of official and community plugins to achieve almost any task imaginable and that was well, really nice.​

I would like to go full-blown mode on the tiniest details of this website's construction, some tutorials maybe. That does require some work on my part, and I would like to start with an outline before anything else (yes, this post isn't outlined​). Also, since there is considerable instructional material available online (including the [source code](https://www.abdulsohu.com/projects) for this website), I can afford to put off the tutorials for now.

## Looking Ahead

For someone who browses [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) because it's therapeutic, it's actually quite foreseeable that my work here, with this website, is not finished. Though, like all good things before they're discovered, I'm not sure what my next discovery in terms of this website is going to be. As of now, having spent nearly two weeks and after putting a lot of thought into the current rendition, I think I can sit back a bit and work on something else.

```java
public class YoursTruly {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    loggingOff();
  }

  public static void loggingOff() {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```
