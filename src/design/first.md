Hello World!

I didn't design this starry sky: nature did. For the time being, I'm working
on some design-related things and as is evident from the quote above, thinking about what
is going to be a super convenient workflow for me in terms of uploading the things I create.
Till then, stay tuned... and enjoy this picture of mountains with a starry sky, courtesy of
